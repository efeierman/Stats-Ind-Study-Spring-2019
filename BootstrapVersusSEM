%Bootstrap versus SEM

%start with a data set of 1k points taken from a normal distribution
mu = 10;
sigma = 5;
N = 1000;

originalData = normrnd(mu,sigma,N,1);

%mean of data set 
originalMean = mean(originalData)

%SEM of data set
originalSEM = (std(originalData)/sqrt(length(originalData)))

%Mean +/- SEM
meanPlusSEM = originalMean + originalSEM
meanMinusSEM = originalMean - originalSEM

%Print results

%Bootstrapping
%we want to generate 1k different samples with 1k points that are
%randomly selected from our original distribution of 1k points 
%then find the means from those samples, then sort the means in order (from
%smallest to largest)
%the bounds of this confidence interval will be bound by the 25th and 975th
%value (middle 95% of values) 

sampledMeans = zeros(1000,1);

for ii = 1:length(sampledMeans)
    sampledData = datasample(originalData,1000);
    sampledMeans(ii) = mean(sampledData);

% calculate 95% confidence interval
